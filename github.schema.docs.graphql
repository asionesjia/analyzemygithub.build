Analyze the provided text (which contains two parts: Date information and Readme text). The task consists of two sub-tasks: first, infer the user's possible country and credibility based on Date active time zone and Readme text information; second, analyze the fields that the user may have expertise in through the Readme text and return a list of corresponding tags representing their areas of expertise and the degree of proficiency.

# Steps

1. **Identify and Extract Date Information**:
   - Identify and extract the Date information from the provided text.
   - Parse the Date's format to ensure proper identification of year, month, and day.
   - Determine the possible active time zone based on the given Date information.

2. **Determine User's Location and Credibility**:
   - Use the active time zone derived from the Date to infer the user's likely country.
   - Gather additional geographical or cultural hints from the Readme text to assist in determining the probable location.
   - **Assess User Credibility**:
     - Evaluate credibility based on both the content and writing style of the Readme text:
       - **Linguistic Analysis**: Consider grammatical consistency, tone, and clarity of the language to determine credibility.
       - **Content Depth**: Evaluate whether the Readme provides thorough explanations, showcases domain knowledge, or includes clear, detailed statements.
     - Assign a credibility score on a scale from 0-5 (0: very untrustworthy, 5: very trustworthy).

3. **Analyze Readme Content for Areas of Expertise**:
   - **Identify Expertise Areas**: Analyze the Readme section to identify any specific technologies, domains, or expertise areas.
   - **Determine Skill Proficiency by Field and Technology**:
     - Group the identified skills into specific fields (e.g., frontend development, backend development).
     - Assign a proficiency level to each skill (L0-L5):
       - L0: Completely unfamiliar
       - L1-L2: Basic understanding / beginner
       - L3-L4: Intermediate / developing expertise
       - L5: Highly proficient / expert knowledge.
     - Structure each field with related technology stacks, showing individual proficiencies for each.

# Output Format

The output should include:

1. **User Location and Credibility**:
   - `"country"`: The inferred country based on provided data and time zone analysis.
   - `"credibility"`: A numerical rating of the user’s credibility from 0 to 5.

2. **Areas of Expertise**:
   - A list of fields (e.g., machine learning, front-end development) and associated proficiency levels.
   - Format the output as follows:

```json
{
  "user_info": {
    "country": "[Inferred country]",
    "credibility": [0-5]
  },
  "expertise_fields": [
    {
      "field": "[Field name]",
      "proficiency": [
        {
           "field": "[skill_tag]"
           "level": "L0-L5"
        },
        {
           "field": "[skill_tag]"
           "level": "L0-L5"
        },
      ]
    },
    {
      "field": "[Field name]",
      "level": "L0-L5"
      "proficiency": [
        {
           "field": "[skill_tag]"
           "level": "L0-L5"
        },
        {
           "field": "[skill_tag]"
           "level": "L0-L5"
        },
      ]
    },
  ]
}
```

# Examples

**Input**:
```
Date: March 15, 2023
Readme: "I have been working with Java and SpringBoot mainly, but I am shifting my focus to front-end development with React."
```

**Output**:
```json
{
  "user_info": {
    "country": "United States",
    "credibility": 3
  },
  "expertise_fields": [
    {
      "field": "backend development",
      "proficiency": [
        {
          "field": "SpringBoot",
          "level": "L5"
        },
        {
          "field": "Flask",
          "level": "L3"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "field": "front-end development",
      "proficiency": [
        {
          "field": "Next.js",
          "level": "L5"
        },
        {
          "field": "React",
          "level": "L5"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

*(Note: Real examples should have more extensive readme content that may refer to multiple skill areas, hence resulting in more diverse expertise fields and proficiency ratings.)*

# Notes

- **Date Formats**: Date information must support multiple formats (e.g., "YYYY年MM月DD日", "MM/DD/YYYY", or "Month DD, YYYY").
- **Inference Context**: Use cultural references, common expressions, or technical terminology to infer the user's region.
- **Credibility Scale Justification**: Provide additional reasoning for each credibility rating to support transparency.
- **Skill Matching Cues**: Look for specific keywords, technologies, and contextual cues that demonstrate the user's familiarity or level of expertise within different domains.
